    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <h4>
        <ol>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</ol>
        <ol>Combine oregano, parsley, paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper in a small bowl.</ol>
        <ol>Place green beans, potato, bell pepper, broccoli, and garlic onto sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle 1/2 of the seasoning mix; toss to coat.</ol>
        <ol>Place flour into a bowl. Place melted butter into a second bowl. Mix panko, 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese, and the reaming seasoning mix together in a third bowl.</ol>
        <ol>Slice chicken in 1 1/4-inch strips, then coat in flour. Dredge floured strips in melted butter, dripping excess butter back into bowl. Press into the Parmesan-panko mixture until heavily coated on both sides.</ol>
        <ol>push veggies to one half of sheet pan. Place coated chicken onto the other side. Sprinkle any remaining Parmesan-panko mixture over the chicken, pressing to adhere.</ol>
        <ol>Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and stir veggies, then continue baking until chicken juices run clear and veggies are crisp-tender 10-15 more minutes.</ol>
        <ol>Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce: Whisk mayo, ketchup, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl.</ol>
        <ol>Remove chicken and veggies from oven. Toss veggies with remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Serve with dipping sauce.</ol>
